# README.md

So far, Ive primarily been using [Astral `uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) as a drop-in pip replacement.  

However, Ive never really explored using it for projects, or most of its other feature. 

When RealPython did a tutorial on it, I felt it was about time to exlore some more of uv's functionality.   

See [Managing Python Projects With uv: An All-in-One Solution â€“ Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-uv/) for the tutorial.

Alongside working through the uv tutorial, I decided to use Git properly for the first time for version control, and am storing this project on GitHub (also for the first time). I do have a bit to do with Git and Azure Dev Ops at work, while working with the data engineers. 

In the distant past, I have used CVS for version control / local code repos. However, up til recently, Ive just kept local normal files for code as I havent really needed version control and havent really been writing anything that needed it.

However, now that Im often working on multiple computers, and have a number of projects on the go for various things, I figured it was time to brush up my knowledge and general Git understanding and fluency.
