# README.md

Ive been using [Astral `uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for a while as a replacement for pip.

However, Ive never really explored using it for projects, or most of its other feature. 

When RealPython did a tutorial on it, I felt it was about time to look into starting to use it more fully. 

See [Managing Python Projects With uv: An All-in-One Solution â€“ Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-uv/) for the tutorial

Alongside this, Im also working with Git properly for the first time for version control, and am storing this project on GitHub (also for the first time). I do have a bit to do with Git and Azure Dev Ops at work, while working with the data engineers. 

Also, in the dim distant past, I have used CVS for version control / local code repos. However, up til recently, Ive just kept local normal files for code as I havent really needed version control and havent really been writing anything that needed it.

However, now that Im often working on multiple computers, and have a number of projects on the go for various things (plus my new DevOps role), I figured it was time to brush up my knowledge and working fluency around Git.
