# README.md

Ive been using [Astral `uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for a while as a replacement for pip.
However, Ive never really explored using it for projects.

When RealPython did a tutorial on it, I felt it was about time to look into starting to use it more fully. 
See [Managing Python Projects With uv: An All-in-One Solution â€“ Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-uv/)

Alongside this, Im also working with Git properly for the first time for version control, and am storing this project on GitHub (also for the first time).
In the dim distant past, I have used CVS for version control / local code repos, but have just kept local files of code up til recently.
